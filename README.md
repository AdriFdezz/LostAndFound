üê∂üîé **LostAndFound** is a mobile application for **Android** designed to help users report and track lost pets. The app allows users to create posts about missing animals, including essential details such as name, age, breed, last known location, and a photo of the pet. Other users can view these posts, report sightings, and communicate with the pet owners. The application features authentication through Firebase, profile management, password recovery with cooldown, and secure data handling via Firestore and Firebase Storage. It aims to provide a platform for the community to assist in reuniting lost pets with their owners in a simple, intuitive interface.

>**Important Note:** üê∂üîé LostAndFound is not intended to replace professional pet recovery services or animal shelters. Instead, it aims to empower local communities by providing a platform for reporting and finding lost pets. LostAndFound offers a practical solution for individuals looking to reunite with their pets, ensuring that those in need of assistance can easily reach out to their neighbors and local community members. While the app helps bridge the gap, professional services should still be contacted in cases requiring immediate or specialized intervention.

## Motivation

The motivation behind creating this application stemmed from a personal desire to learn mobile app development while also creating something useful for people. I wanted to combine my interest in technology with a practical tool that could help individuals in real-life situations. 

I decided to create this application because I believe pets are an important part of people's lives today, and helping people reunite with their lost pets could make a meaningful impact. By developing LostAndFound, I not only gained experience in building a mobile app, but also created a platform that could make a positive impact by helping people reunite with their lost pets.
